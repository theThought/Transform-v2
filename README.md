# Transform-v2
A refactoring of the Transform project moving it to a more modern HTML implementation

This is an Ipsos project for the Transformation of the look and feel of surveys for Healthcare.  The solution is also used by PassiveObservation.

The purpose of this project is to refactor v1, using ES6/TypeScript, HTML Web Components, vanilla CSS, and better implementing atomic design principles. All refactored code can be found in the `UI` folder.

## TODO
- Once refactor is completed, delete the following:
    - `Survey` and `Storybook` folders.
    - `UI/src/css/shame.css` and its import inside `UI/src/css/index.css`.
    - All references to the old Survey CSS in `UI/.storybook/preview-head.html`.
