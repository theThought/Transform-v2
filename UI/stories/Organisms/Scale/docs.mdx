# o-scale
Scale questions are an alternative way of selecting from a range of distinct values between a predefined min and max value.  They are only suitable for small ranges, up to 10 units.  By default each unit is represented by a Square containing the value it represents.  This can be augmented with a background image for each unit.
The scale itself can also have a background image within which the scale container sits.

## Min/Max range
The min and max properties of the number input are used to define the start and end values of the scale. The step value is always 1.
Therefore a min=1 and a max=10 provides a ten point scale

# o-scale-vertical
This is a sub-variant of o-scale providing a vertical version of the scale.  This is more suitable for mobile phones with a preference for just one question on the page.
This uses a similar structure to o-scale, however as the pre/post label are before and after the scale and so separated, the structure does change.

- a-label-pre
- o-scale-container
