# m-singleline
Used to present a singleline input to the user for completion.  The singleline input types current supported as a direct method of input are:
- text
- number

Other singleline input types are used in the background to support other question types, but are not supported as a front-end UI component.

## m-singleline-text
Sets the type to "text"
Supports maxlength property to define the maximum number of characters that can be typed into the input

## m-singleline-number
Sets the type property to "number" 
Supports min/max properties to define the smallest and largest values
Supports the step property (applied via custom properties) to indicate the change for each click of the stepper and the number of decimal places allowed.

## Special codes
m-singleline supports the use of special codes with the selection of a special code dismissing the value entered into the input.  If a new value is entered after a special code is selected then the special code is dismissed.
