# Icons
- Icons are applied as CSS background images.

## Single state icons
- `TODO:` For example, in [messages](/story/molecules-messages--message-error).

## Multi state icons
- Used when displaying an icon as part of an interactive component.
- They have one of four possible states - `unselected`, `selected`, `read only (unselected)`, `read only (selected)`.
- For example, [custom checkboxes](/story/molecules-options--option-multi) when they are selected.
