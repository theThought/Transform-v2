# Icons
- Icons are applied as CSS background images.

## Single state icons
- For example, in [messages](/story/molecules-messages--message-error).

## Multi state icons
- Used when displaying an icon as part of an interactive component.
- They have one of four possible states:
    - `selected`
    - `unselected`
    - `read only` selected
    - `read only` unselected
- For example, [custom checkboxes](/story/molecules-options--option-multi) when they are selected.
