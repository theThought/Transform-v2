# Listbox Playground
A Listbox provides the user with a series of options in a constrained space.  It is also the base component for other response types that contain a list:
<ul>
<li>Combobox</li>
<li>Dropdown</li>
<li>Longlist</li>
</ul> 

## List with a few items
This is a listbox with just a small number of items, to demonstrate the basic concept
<Canvas of={ListStories.TListbox_Short} />
<Controls of={ListStories.TListbox_Short} />

## List with lots of items
Performance is key and so having 1,000s of items in the list needs to be tested.
<Canvas of={ListStories.TListbox_Long} />
<Controls of={ListStories.TListbox_Long} />
