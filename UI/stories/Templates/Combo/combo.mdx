# Combobox Playground
A combobox provides the user with a series of options in a constrained space. It offers filtering to limit the content of the list to help a user find an item more quickly.

## List with a few items
This is a listbox with just a small number of items, to demonstrate the basic concept
<Canvas of={ComboStories.TCombobox_Long} />
<Controls of={ComboStories.TCombobox_Long} />

## List with lots of items
Performance is key and so having 1,000s of items in the list needs to be tested.
