# Scale Playground
There are three singleline examples shown here reflecting the the type input types currently supported.  
singleline exposes a singleline editbox to the respondent to allow an open-ended response. 

## scale
A scale has an underlying numeric question that has a range (usually from 1 to 5,7 or 10).  Each value in that range is shown as a unit.  The respondent is able to select the unit representing their answer, the value of which is stored in the response.
