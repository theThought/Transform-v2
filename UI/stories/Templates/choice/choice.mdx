# choice Playground
There are three singleline examples shown here reflecting the the type input types currently supported.  
singleline exposes a singleline editbox to the respondent to allow an open-ended response. 

## simple list
The most basic choice question is a simple list of options, no headings no exclusive options.  This can be either a single-answer or a multi-answer question.

## simple multi-choice is exclusive options
Within a multi-choice question the respondent can select a number of options, however some options are considered exclusive (when selected no other option can be selected).
